=head1 NAME

AnyEvent::HTTP - simple but non-blocking HTTP/HTTPS client

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use AnyEvent::HTTP;

   http_get "http://www.nethype.de/", sub { print $_[1] };

   # ... do something else here

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is an L<AnyEvent> user, you need to make sure that you use and
run a supported event loop.

This module implements a simple, stateless and non-blocking HTTP
client. It supports GET, POST and other request methods, cookies and more,
all on a very low level. It can follow redirects supports proxies and
automatically limits the number of connections to the values specified in
the RFC.

It should generally be a "good client" that is enough for most HTTP
tasks. Simple tasks should be simple, but complex tasks should still be
possible as the user retains control over request and response headers.

The caller is responsible for authentication management, cookies (if
the simplistic implementation in this module doesn't suffice), referer
and other high-level protocol details for which this module offers only
limited support.

=item http_get $url, key => value..., $cb->($data, $headers)

Executes an HTTP-GET request. See the http_request function for details on
additional parameters.

=item http_head $url, key => value..., $cb->($data, $headers)

Executes an HTTP-HEAD request. See the http_request function for details on
additional parameters.

=item http_post $url, $body, key => value..., $cb->($data, $headers)

Executes an HTTP-POST request with a request body of C<$bod>. See the
http_request function for details on additional parameters.

=item http_request $method => $url, key => value..., $cb->($data, $headers)

Executes a HTTP request of type C<$method> (e.g. C<GET>, C<POST>). The URL
must be an absolute http or https URL.

The callback will be called with the response data as first argument
(or C<undef> if it wasn't available due to errors), and a hash-ref with
response headers as second argument.

All the headers in that hash are lowercased. In addition to the response
headers, the "pseudo-headers" C<HTTPVersion>, C<Status> and C<Reason>
contain the three parts of the HTTP Status-Line of the same name. The
pseudo-header C<URL> contains the original URL (which can differ from the
requested URL when following redirects).

If the server sends a header multiple lines, then their contents will be
joined together with C<\x00>.

If an internal error occurs, such as not being able to resolve a hostname,
then C<$data> will be C<undef>, C<< $headers->{Status} >> will be C<599>
and the C<Reason> pseudo-header will contain an error message.

A typical callback might look like this:

   sub {
      my ($body, $hdr) = @_;

      if ($hdr->{Status} =~ /^2/) {
         ... everything should be ok
      } else {
         print "error, $hdr->{Status} $hdr->{Reason}\n";
      }
   }

Additional parameters are key-value pairs, and are fully optional. They
include:

=over 4

=item recurse => $count (default: $MAX_RECURSE)

Whether to recurse requests or not, e.g. on redirects, authentication
retries and so on, and how often to do so.

=item headers => hashref

The request headers to use. Currently, C<http_request> may provide its
own C<Host:>, C<Content-Length:>, C<Connection:> and C<Cookie:> headers
and will provide defaults for C<User-Agent:> and C<Referer:>.

=item timeout => $seconds

The time-out to use for various stages - each connect attempt will reset
the timeout, as will read or write activity. Default timeout is 5 minutes.

=item proxy => [$host, $port[, $scheme]] or undef

Use the given http proxy for all requests. If not specified, then the
default proxy (as specified by C<$ENV{http_proxy}>) is used.

C<$scheme> must be either missing or C<http> for HTTP, or C<https> for
HTTPS.

=item body => $string

The request body, usually empty. Will be-sent as-is (future versions of
this module might offer more options).

=item cookie_jar => $hash_ref

Passing this parameter enables (simplified) cookie-processing, loosely
based on the original netscape specification.

The C<$hash_ref> must be an (initially empty) hash reference which will
get updated automatically. It is possible to save the cookie_jar to
persistent storage with something like JSON or Storable, but this is not
recommended, as expire times are currently being ignored.

Note that this cookie implementation is not of very high quality, nor
meant to be complete. If you want complete cookie management you have to
do that on your own. C<cookie_jar> is meant as a quick fix to get some
cookie-using sites working. Cookies are a privacy disaster, do not use
them unless required to.

Example: make a simple HTTP GET request for http://www.nethype.de/

   http_request GET => "http://www.nethype.de/", sub {
      my ($body, $hdr) = @_;
      print "$body\n";
   };

Example: make a HTTP HEAD request on https://www.google.com/, use a
timeout of 30 seconds.

   http_request
      GET     => "https://www.google.com",
      timeout => 30,
      sub {
         my ($body, $hdr) = @_;
         use Data::Dumper;
         print Dumper $hdr;
      }

=item AnyEvent::HTTP::set_proxy "proxy-url"

Sets the default proxy server to use. The proxy-url must begin with a
string of the form C<http://host:port> (optionally C<https:...>).

=item $AnyEvent::HTTP::MAX_RECURSE

The default value for the C<recurse> request parameter (default: C<10>).

=item $AnyEvent::HTTP::USERAGENT

The default value for the C<User-Agent> header (the default is
C<Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; AnyEvent::HTTP/$VERSION; +http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/AnyEvent)>).

=item $AnyEvent::HTTP::MAX_PERSISTENT

The maximum number of persistent connections to keep open (default: 8).

Not implemented currently.

=item $AnyEvent::HTTP::PERSISTENT_TIMEOUT

The maximum time to cache a persistent connection, in seconds (default: 2).

Not implemented currently.

=item $AnyEvent::HTTP::ACTIVE

The number of active connections. This is not the number of currently
running requests, but the number of currently open and non-idle TCP
connections. This number of can be useful for load-leveling.
